SNHU CS-210 Programming Languages

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. The project that I chose was project 2. This is where we created a banking app for investment accounts. This app allowed the financial instituion to be able to provide their customers with a secure place to invest their money and see how the accounts grow with mathematical calculations to show initial investment and yearly returns.

What did you do particularly well? I thought that I organized my code quite well. This was my first time really taking a stab at OOP and although I have plenty of room to learn, grow, and improve, I thought this wasn't a bad start.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? I thought that I added inline comments in quite well but one recommendation a developer friend of mine suggested was adding in a multi-line description at the beginning to describe the purpose of the app. She pointed out that I may not always be the person working on or debugging the code so it would be wise to be as informative as possible with your comments.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? I found as trying to write this with OOP in mind, tying all the different files together for the first time to be difficult. I never really creatd a header file before so having to do the research through our text and reaching out to people that I know personally to help tutor me was beneficial.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? The first skill that comes to mind is just the practice of coding in C++. It is an invaluable skill and you can't get better at something without putting hands to keyboard if you will. Learning the fundamentals of programming thus far has changed the way I think and approach problems. It forces you to become a problem solver and to do research.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by creating the different .cpp files and a header file. Instead of everything being stacked on top of each other in one file everything becomes more managable and not as cumbersome on the eyes. the smaller blocks of code makes it easier to keep track of where you are and to make any updates you need.
